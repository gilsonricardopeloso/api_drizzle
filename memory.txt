$ npx @eslint/migrate-config .eslintrc.js
Need to install the following packages:
@eslint/migrate-config@1.3.3
Ok to proceed? (y) y


Migrating .eslintrc.js

WARNING: This tool does not yet work great for .eslintrc.(js|cjs|mjs) files.
It will convert the evaluated output of our config file, not the source code.
Please review the output carefully to ensure it is correct.


Wrote new config to ./eslint.config.mjs

You will need to install the following packages to use the new config:
- globals
- @eslint/js
- @eslint/eslintrc

You can install them using the following command:

npm install globals @eslint/js @eslint/eslintrc -D

The following messages were generated during migration:
- The 'node' environment is used, but the sourceType is 'module'. Using sourceType 'module'. If you want to use CommonJS modules, set the sourceType to 'commonjs'.

$ npm install globals @eslint/js @eslint/eslintrc -D
